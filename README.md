# Introduction
This repository is a curated collection of solutions for a variety of courses from Peking University, covering subjects like basic mathematics, numerical methods, machine learning, and quantum computing. These courses range from advanced undergraduate to early graduate levels and are presented in both English and Chinese. The goal of this repository is to aid in your studies by providing a resource for checking work, receiving hints, or finding solutions when encountering challenges.

# Usage Guidelines
The content is organized by course, with each course having its own dedicated folder containing solutions. Official course websites may provide relevant problem sets and materials. In cases where problem sets are from specific textbooks, these can be purchased online. For other courses, where direct posting of problem sets is not feasible due to intellectual property considerations, requests can be made via email to receive them, subject to availability.


You are welcome to use these materials for personal study. Understanding and rephrasing solutions for your own homework is permissible without citing this repository. However, bear in mind the risks involved, such as submitting partially correct answers. I must emphasize that I'm **by no means** responsible for the correctness of the solutions. My hope is that my solutions can serve as inspirations for ways to approach the problems. If you find any errors, please initiate an issue or a pull request.

# Contributing
Contributions are highly encouraged. If you spot errors in the solutions, please initiate an issue or a pull request. Additionally, if you possess problem sets from Peking University courses in mathematics, computer science, data science, physics, etc., that are not currently included, consider contributing via pull request or email. Your input is greatly appreciated.
